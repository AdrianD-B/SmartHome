# SmartHome Build Instructions

## 1) Introduction and system diagram

These are the build instructions for my Smart Home temperature sensor.

## 3) Time commitment

First, it should take you about a week to aquire all the components. (1 week)

Second, setting up stm32 bootloader and breadboarding. (1~3 hours)

third, coding and power up. (1 hour)

fourth, when you receive your pcb(or already have it) and solder the components. (1~3 hours)

Entire project assembly should only take a weekend, there might be some time gain or loss depending on if you solder well or not, or mistakenly have the wrong connections and making sure each part is connected correctly.

## 4) Mechanical assembly

this is the pcb board designed

finished breadboard desgin should look like this:

## 5) PCB soldering

## 6) Power up

place the sensor in hot water too increase the resistance and ice for a lower resistance. (note that for me it took a long time to see a temperature difference so you can leave it overnight to test it). To test the buzzer, you can change the value to see if it buzzes or not.
